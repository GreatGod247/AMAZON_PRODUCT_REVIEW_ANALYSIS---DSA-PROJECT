A clean, interactive dashboard was created in **Excel** to visualize insights such as:
- Product count by category  
- Total reviews by category  
- Average rating by category  
- Revenue potential by category  
- Price range distribution  
- Top-rated and top-reviewed products  
- Discounts vs ratings relationship

The dashboard helps e-commerce sellers quickly identify product performance trends and areas of opportunity.
